# Description

In this project, we will attempt to create the basic structure of a webpage using HTML only, without any CSS. Having learnt in the past weeks, the basic structure of HTML websites, and what it means to create a head and body, we will now present what we have learnt in a full website format, to prove that we have understood the concepts taught and shared in the previous learning sessions.

# RESOURCES

- [Learn to Code HTML & CSS (until “Creating Lists” included)](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/)
- [Introduction to HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML)

# LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this project, we are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without any help, these basic concepts;

# General

- HTML
- DOM
- Elements/tags and their purposes
- Attributes

# MANUAL REVIEW

Once this is complete, we will need to show that we are ready for review by selecting the "Ready for my review" tab to enable our peers to review us. Note that, without a manual review the project isincomplete and there will be no grade awarded. You would also need to put in time to review a peer, as it is only right to give what been given to you.
